AI Smart Attendance &amp; Performance Tracker is a MERN stack web application that manages student records, attendance, and academic performance in a simple and efficient way. The system calculates attendance percentage, analyzes marks, and provides automatic performance remarks and attendance shortage warnings using AI-assisted logic.
📌 Project Title

AI Smart Attendance & Performance Tracker (MERN Stack)

📖 Overview

This project is a web-based system developed using the MERN stack to manage student attendance and marks digitally. It replaces manual Excel-based record keeping with an organized database-driven system that provides quick insights into student performance and attendance status.

The system uses AI-assisted logic to automatically generate performance remarks and attendance shortage warnings.
